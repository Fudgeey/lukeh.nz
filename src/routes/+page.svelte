                    I'm Luke, a full-time student at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.
                    Currently in my second year, studying towards a Bachelor's of Science, majoring in Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics.
                    I have been programming for nearly a decade now, and have always enjoyed it, and I look forward to continue it.
                    <br><br>
                    This website was put together to mainly show off some of my previous projects I have created, so feel free to have a look!
                    <br><br>
                    In my free time I enjoy going on hikes, which is one of the reasons I moved to Christchurch, so close to both the Port Hills and the Southern Alps.
                    In the winter, I also enjoy going skiing, even if I'm not very good at it. I also enjoy running, especially around Hagley Park, and hopefully will
                    be running the Queenstown Half Marathon in November 2024.
